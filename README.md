### I'm Guillermo. I am a Full Stack Web Developer currently looking for opportunities to learn and grow.

- ⚙️ Technologies I normally work with include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6, React, Context API, Node, and Express.
- ⏭️ Next Technologies I am looking forward to learn are Firebase, Redux, React Native and Go.
- 💻 I’m currently working as a Frontend Developer at Trisbee, a fintech startup for cashless payment solutions.

- 😄 I’m passionate about Full Stack development and really enjoy working on all aspects of a project from start to finish. My interest mostly lies in the Front End and React, but doing the Back End is something I really enjoy too.
